# WebAssembly for a-Shell

### What is WebAssembly and how it works with a-Shell?

Due to Apple's safety policy, external binary codes outside of the app itself are forbidden to run. Thus theoretically there won't be a compiler for iOS/iPadOS that we can run and test the codes generated by it conveniently. What C/C++ compiler inside both a-Shell and Code App generates are not iOS/iPadOS native binary files but WebAssembly object codes. With the WebAssembly runtime environment, we can test the codes we write. But what is WebAssembly and why it's chosen to work with the C/C++ compiler?

As the speed of JavaScript is slow, some people hope there can be a technology that can introduce low-level program languages to the web browser, thus WebAssembly is born. It seems to be a kind of new "programming language" but actually it's a kind of object code that can be executed on different architectures and systems, and it's well-known for its safety and efficiency.

As some people have noticed WebAssembly's features, they guess it can be used to write cross-platform projects. Thus, there should be a runtime like Java to provide a way to run WebAssembly codes outside of the browser.
